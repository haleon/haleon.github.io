This is a cheese flavored blog powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted through GitHub Pages.

To share and document the process I’ve created a comprehensive how-to on launching static websites with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The documentation also serves as a simple introduction to Git and GitHub which I found to be more than a little confusing at first (It’s actually quite straight forward once you get the hang of it!). Links to this and other things I’m obsessed with on are on my website, http://haleon.github.io./.
